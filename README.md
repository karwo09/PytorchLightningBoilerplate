# PytorchLightningBoilerplate
Here is a collection of my boilerplate code for pytorch lightning. The idea is to be able to take any pytorch model and easily wrap it in pytorch lightning with all of its functionality

I have added some tests and some basic functionality one might want to have out of the box.

## Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
````
## Conda Environment Setup
- Create a new Conda environment with Python 3.8:

````
conda create -n myenv python=3.8
````

- Activate the new environment:

````
conda activate myenv
````

- Install the Python dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Docker setup
Use the container as you will. It can be run also through the docker-compose
